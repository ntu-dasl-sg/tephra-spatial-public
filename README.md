## Author Contributions

MR lead the writing, research and analysis of both case studies. All authors contributed to the conceptualisation and design of the study. DL conceived of the idea of celebrating successes in disaster risk reduction using counterfactual analysis. YL and DL provided critical feedback that shaped the research, analysis and manuscript.
