## TEPHRA2 OVERVIEW

Our study utilises tephra2 (VERSION 2.0), a tephra dispersion simulation tool used to estimate the mass of tephra that will accumulate at a site or over a region, given explosive eruption conditions. The code was developed by Laura J. Connor and Costanza Bonadonna. Detailed documentation of the software are provided in [Github](https://github.com/geoscience-community-codes/tephra2), [Tephra2 website](https://gscommunitycodes.usf.edu/geoscicommunitycodes/public/tephra2/tephra2.php), and Sebastian Biass' [website](https://e5k.github.io/codes/utilities/2018/06/06/inversion/). 

- Year first available: 2013
- Version used in our study: 2.0, Updated 01-27-2018
- Program language: C
- License: GNU General Public License v3.0
- Availability: https://github.com/geoscience-community-codes/tephra2
- Program size: 963 KB
- Hardware requirements: The inversion model requires MPI (Message Passing Interface) libraries and should be run on a computing cluster with multiple compute nodes. 

### Tephra2 Quick Start

First, download the Tephra2 source code, which is available on [Github](https://github.com/geoscience-community-codes/tephra2). Alternatively, a copy of the source code is provided here in `/src/tephra2-master-2/`. If interested, instructions for parallelisation are provided [here](https://e5k.github.io/codes/utilities/2018/06/06/inversion/).

#### Install dependencies before compiling:

- gcc
- openmpi
- gc, gc-devel, libatomic_ops (for opensuse linux) or libgc-dev, libgc1c2 (for ubuntu linux) or bdw-gc (mac - homebrew)

#### Compilation and Usage

tephra2 is written in C, a compiled language, and must be compiled before it can be executed. The compilation of Tephra2 results to two executables (tephra2012_inversion and tephra2-2012).
```
    To compile type make
```
Two configuration files are needed, one for the forward model (tephra2.conf) and another for the inversion model (tephra2-inversion.conf). The program user can change any of the values inside the configuration file; the keywords must not be changed.

To run the inversion and forward model, run the `run-inversion` script.

```
    Edit tephra2.conf 
    This is the forward model configuration file.
    
    Edit tephra2-inversion.conf
    This is the inversion configuration file.
    
    Edit the run-inversion script. 
    This script will:
    1)  run the inversion part of tephra2, 
    2)  run PERL/GMT scripts which generate some PNG images of wind field, plume probabilities,
    3)  run the forward tephra2 model with the best-fit results,
    4)  run PERL/GMT scripts to plot contours
    
    USAGE: nohup sh run-inversion > nohup.out &
    
    USE: cd tail -f nohup.out
    to view stderr and stdout as it is being saved to this file.
```

### Changing the cost functions

For our paper, we modified the Tephra2 executables to change the cost functions in the optimisation. The modified executables for the following cost functions are provided in: `/src/executables/`
- Chi-squared error
- Mean absolute error (MAE)
- Mean squared error (MSE)
- Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
- Mean squared logarithmic error (MSLE)
- Tokyo-log error

Proceed with running the inversion using the executable that corresponds to the cost function of interest.

To incorporate other cost functions to the original source code, see our guide: `doc/add-costf.md`
