# Data on tephra load

Our collaboration with George Williams, Sebastien Biasse and Susanna Jenkins during George William's PhD research in 2019 allowed this work to make use of the data in this folder. This data was passed on to us in the hope of it being useful for volcanic research. Please contact the corresponding author for any aims to publish or present this data.

We thank George and Sebastien for formatting and digitising the data from CVGHM and Maeno's paper to produce these input files compatible with Tephra2.

A complete description of the data is provided in our manuscript.

## 1 - Kelud_deposit_after2-3days_CVGHM_81points.csv
Deposits were measured 2-3 days post-eruption

## 2 - Kelud_deposit_after3weeks_Maeno_50points.csv
Measurements taken three weeks later (though they argue that the thicknesses would not have compacted down or been washed away at all during this time...)
Data is from supplementary from this paper by Maeno:
